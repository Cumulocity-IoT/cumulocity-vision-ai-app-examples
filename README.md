# Vision AI Demos for IMX500 & Cumulocity  üöÄ

This repository contains a collection of Vision AI demonstrations designed to run on an **IMX500-based Raspberry Pi AI Camera** and integrate with the **Cumulocity platform**.

Each demo includes:
* An AI model
* A custom AI application (`.deb`) to run on the Raspberry Pi
* One or more Analytics Builder model files (`.json`) for data processing in Cumulocity
* Example dashboard screenshots for visualization

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* **Hardware:** A Raspberry Pi with a Raspberry Pi AI Camera (based on IMX500).
* **Software:**
    * A Cumulocity IoT tenant with administrator credentials.
    * The Vision AI extension for Cumulocity Devicemangement. 
    * Your Raspberry Pi is flashed with a supported OS and is connected to the internet.
    * The Raspberry Pi AI camera is connected and recognized (you can check the [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/ai-camera.html))

## ‚öôÔ∏è General Installation and Setup

These steps are common for all demos in this repository.

### 1. Prepare the device and connect it to Cumulocity

First, you need to connect your Raspberry Pi to your Cumulocity tenant.
We will use [thin-edge.io](https://thin-edge.io/) for that, which will also give us all the Devicemanagement capabilities of Cumulocity.

* Install thin-edge.io on your Raspberry Pi following this documentation: https://thin-edge.github.io/thin-edge.io/install/
* Afterwards connect it to Cumulocity following this documentation: https://thin-edge.github.io/thin-edge.io/start/connect-c8y/
* After a few moments, your device will appear in the **Device Management** application in Cumulocity.
* Install the thin-edge plugin for Vision AI. You can download it **here TODO** (the installation prodcedure is the same as described below for the AI application).
* After installation you should the a child-device in Cumulocity under your connected Raspberry Pi.

### 2. Install the AI Application

Each demo has a specific Debian package (`.deb`) that runs the AI inference on the device.

*  **Log in to your Cumulocity tenant.**
*  Navigate to the **Devicemanagement** application.
*  In the left-hand menu, go to **Management > Software Repository**.
*  Click **Add software** in the top-right corner.
*  As software type you should use `apt` and as the version it has to match the version of the debian package (see the file DEBIAN/control)
*  Drag and drop your `.deb` file or browse to select it.
*  Once uploaded, the software will be available in your tenant for deployment to devices.
*  Finally go to your (Raspberry Pi) device in Cumulocity and install the app via the software tab

### 3. Deploy the AI Model

The AI model must be deployed to the device via the Cumulocity platform.

* In the Cumulocity UI, navigate to the **Devicemanagement** application.
* In the left-hand menu, go to **Management > AI Model Repository**.
* Click **Add model** in the top-right corner.
* Drag and drop your model file or browse to select it.
* Once the model is uploaded navigate to your device and find the child-device that represents the camera.
* Go to the tab **AI Model**, click **Install modell**, select your model and click **Install**.
* Once the model has be successfully downloaded to the camera you can activate it with the toggle from the same UI.

### 4. Import the Analytics Builder Flow

The Analytics Builder flow processes the inference data sent from the device.

* Navigate to the **Analytics Builder** application in Cumulocity.
* On the top right, click **Import**.
* Select and upload the `.json` model file provided in the demo folder.
* The model will appear in your list. You may need to activate it.

### 5. Create a Dashboard

Using the processed data, you can create a dashboard to visualize the results. Use the example screenshots in each demo folder as a guide to create your own widgets (e.g., Data Point Graph, Image Widget, SCADA).

## üèóÔ∏è Building from Source (Optional)

If you wish to modify and build the AI applications yourself, instructions are provided within each demo's respective directory. You will typically need the a Python developer environment.
